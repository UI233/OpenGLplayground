# OpenGLplayground

## Description

This is my toy project. I would like to implement some algorithms related to rendering in game dev such as shadowmapping, SSAO and etc.  using *OpenGL*. 

## Dependency 

- OpenGL 4.5
- GLM
- GLFW
- GL3W
- Assimp
- stb_image

All projects in this repository are compiled using MSVC so I am not sure whether it works well on g++.

## Table of Contents

- Shadow Mapping
