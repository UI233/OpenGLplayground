# OpenGLplayground

## Description

This is my toy project. I would like to implement some algorithms related to rendering in game dev such as shadowmapping, SSAO and etc using *OpenGL*. 

## Dependency 

- OpenGL 4.5
- GLM
- GLFW
- GL3W
- Assimp
- stb_image

All projects in this repository is compiled using MSVC so I am not sure that it works well on g++.

## List of Implementation

- Shadow Mapping
